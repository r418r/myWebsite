            My name is Rio, and I earned a B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics from UCSB in 2020. I currently teach NGSS Physics and AP Physics 1 at the high school level.<br>
            I am passionate about both teaching and continuous learning. While I enjoy guiding students through physics, I also expand my expertise in AI, data analysis, and electrical engineering to apply my skills beyond the classroom. I am studying circuit theory with Fundamentals of Electric Circuits (Alexander & Sadiku), data analysis through the Google Data Analytics course (Coursera), and machine learning from sources like Fast.ai and Google AI Coursework. I also reference several good textbooks such as Linear Algebra Done Right (S. Axler) and Introduction to Electrodynamics (D. Griffiths) to reinforce key concepts. My current studies in circuit theory, data analytics, and machine learning are part of my transition into AI and embedded systems, where I aim to work on autonomous technologies. Additionally, I am passively learning Italian on Duolingo.<br>
            <br>
            In my free time, I enjoy solving mathematics or physics problems, hang out with my friends such as my wonderful best friend Rufino, or spend time with my wife Ana and my son Satoshi.
