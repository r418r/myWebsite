    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Auto-Drive MiniCar.</b> Using a microprocessor and basic mechanical pieces, I want to build a small car that drives itself, following landmark cues and EM signals (equivalent of traffic lights) without colliding into obstacles.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Cloud-Based IoT Dashboard.</b> Using a AWS IoT Core, I want to integrate an automation system in my house by monitoring the sensor data. In addition, I want to add build an interface to visualize any necessary data or notifications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Project Euler.</b> Ongoing problem-solving project that is provided online; I use this to practice my python coding skills.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Network Intrusion Detection System.</b> I want to build myself an AI-based detection system of malicious network activities, which flags any suspicious patterns and logs these traffic data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Signal Analyzer.</b> Using a microprocessor and antenna, I want to build a small device that detects and analyzes the EM waves that are present at a point of space.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Stock Predictor.</b> I plan to develop a stock price prediction software using machine learning, incorporating a Markov Chain model to analyze stock patterns and forecast trends. Additionally, I aim to integrate a feature that examines correlations between stock movements across multiple companies. This will involve evaluating the causal relationships between stock price fluctuations, allowing for an analysis of how the rise or fall of one company may impact others.
